Explanation of the idea:

 It's a combat platformer, for two players (hotseat)
 You're inside of a room full of hazards to avoid, and platforms to jump on to.
 Each player has a pile of tiles with arrows (8 possibilities)
 aside from the movement buttons, they have 2 action buttons: "activate" and "discard"
 with "activate", they consume the current tile.  The arrow indicates the new "down" direction
 with "discard", the current tile is discarded, and the next one in the pile becomes the current
 with a timer, a new tile is dropped every X time... the delay can change over time to make the game more hectic
 also, new hazards could appear in the level over time, making it more dangerous
 the first not to die is the winner
 
 then there's a score...
